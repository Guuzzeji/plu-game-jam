General overview on resources to use on how to use GitHub and Git.

> **MOST IMPORTANT** : NEVER PUSH DIRECTLY INTO THE MAIN BRANCH. ALWAYS MAKE A PULL REQUEST WHEN YOU ARE READING TO ADD STUFF TO MAIN.

## How to setup simple

- Download git for you OS, from https://git-scm.com/downloads

- Then download Github Desktop for you OS, from https://desktop.github.com/
  - This is a GUI system for git, so you don't have to use the command line to manage your branches

- Then fork the repository and make your changes into a new branch, then once you are done create a pull request for other people to review and check into main branch
